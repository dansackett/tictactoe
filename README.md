# TicTacToe

This is a fun side project meant to explore game concepts and technology. This
was built primarily with NextJS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. I leveraged
Copilot to help formulate the AI algorithms.

##  Running the App

This is a NextJS app so typical flow is:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
